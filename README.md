# dotlessdots

This repository mainly contains my Archlinix dotfiles as well as some other customizations and scripts.

## My usual workflow

I mainly use a tiling window manager (i.e., i3) in conjunction with a combination of GUI/CLI programs. The programs I frequently use are:

+ i3
+ i3bar with conky
+ a patched Tint2 version as a detached tray icons application
+ vim 
+ dmenu
+ mpd with ncmpcpp
+ Thunar
+ mpv
+ dunst
+ GIMP, Synfig, Inkscape
+ zsh with custom functions
+ and many little scripts I wrote for different purposes using several languages (e.g., Bash, Python, JavaScript, etc.)

## Screenshot

They say that an image is worth a thousand words, so without further due, here is how my typical desktop looks like:
