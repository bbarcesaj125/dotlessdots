# dotlessdots

This repository mainly contains my Archlinix dotfiles as well as some other customizations and scripts.

## My usual workflow

I mainly use a tiling window manager (i.e., Hyprland) in conjunction with a combination of GUI/CLI programs. The programs I frequently use are:

+ Hyprland
+ Waybar
+ ~~AwesomeWM with a customized Powerarrow theme from [AwesomeWM Copycats](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats)~~
+ ~~i3~~
+ ~~i3bar with conky~~
+ ~~a patched Tint2 version as a detached tray area/bar which can be toggled on and off~~
+ vim 
+ Wofi
+ mpd with ncmpcpp
+ Thunar
+ mpv
+ ~~dunst~~
+ Mako
+ GIMP, Synfig, Inkscape
+ zsh with custom functions
+ and many little scripts I wrote for different purposes using several languages (e.g., Bash, Python, JavaScript, etc.)

## Screenshot

They say that an image is worth a thousand words, so without further due, here is how my typical desktop looks like:

## Things I might try in the future

This is a loose todo list that contains things I am strongly interested in. 

- [ ] Switch to bspwm
- [x] Switch to Wayland (Wayland finally seems to be picking up steam. Will consider switching (Sway?) in 2022)
- [x] Switch to AwesomeWM 
- [ ] Switch to Neovim
- [x] Ditch Pathogen in favor of vim's built-in package system
