# My scripts

This is the directory that contains all of my scripts. It is located in my `$HOME` folder (i.e., `~/.scripts/`).

## What are those scripts and what they do?

This is a work in progress. I will try to add comments at the beginning of every script to explain the logic behind them. In the meantime, you are free to browse the scripts, and see for yourself if you can get a thing or two from them!
