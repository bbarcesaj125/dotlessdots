#!/usr/bin/env bash

# This is a simple script that is meant to be used as a thunar custom action to search and play videos files 
# contained in a specific directory.
# It takes in the path of the video directory as input and then gives the user the option 
# to search all the video files in that folder. It provides the user with the option 
# to either preview the video file or play it using mpv.
# To use, create a custom action in thunar with the following options:
# Name: choose whatever name you like
# Description: same as above
# Command: thunarmpvsearch %f
# Where thunarmpvsearch is the name of your script that lurkes somewhere in your PATH (i.e. ~/.local/bin)

# The preview option is merely an mpv commandline option that plays a very small portion 
# starting from the middle of the video using mpv's fast playback option.
# I originally wanted to use ffmpeg and ImageMagick to dynamically generate a GIF preview of the video, 
# but after a few tests I figured that it wasn't worth it since it appeared to use 
# too much system resources for a "preview" feature. 
# In the end, I decided to drop the idea after discovering that mpv actually has a fast forward playback option.

# Dependencies:
# - mpv
# - ffmpeg
# - bc
# - dmenu
